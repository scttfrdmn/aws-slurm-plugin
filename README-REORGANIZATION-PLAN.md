# AWS Plugin for Slurm - README Reorganization Plan

## Current Issues

The existing README documentation has several issues that impact its effectiveness:

1. **Mixed Content Types**: Conceptual overview information is interspersed with technical details, making both harder to understand.

2. **Fragmented Deployment Instructions**: Deployment steps are split between multiple sections, making it difficult to follow a single path to implementation.

3. **Appendix-Heavy Structure**: Important configuration examples are placed as appendices rather than alongside the relevant configuration sections where they would be most useful.

4. **File-Centric Organization**: The documentation is organized around files rather than tasks or user goals, making it harder for new users to understand what to do.

5. **Buried Prerequisites**: Critical information about prerequisites is buried deep in deployment sections rather than highlighted early.

6. **Tutorial/Reference Confusion**: The document attempts to serve as both a tutorial and a reference, but doesn't clearly separate these concerns.

## Proposed Structure

### 1. Introduction
- Brief overview, purpose, and value proposition
- Key features and use cases
- Version information and important changes from previous versions
- Clear statement of when to use this plugin vs. alternatives like AWS ParallelCluster

### 2. Quick Start Guide
- CloudFormation deployment option (focused on fastest path to running)
- Basic usage commands to validate installation
- Link to detailed manual setup for those who need customization

### 3. Architecture & Concepts
- How the plugin integrates with Slurm's power save logic
- Node lifecycle explanation with clear diagrams
- Key components and their relationships
- Conceptual workflow from job submission to instance termination

### 4. Installation Guide
- Prerequisites (clearly highlighted at the beginning)
  - Slurm version requirements
  - Network/connectivity requirements
  - Required software/dependencies
- AWS resources setup steps
  - IAM roles and permissions
  - Subnets and connectivity
  - Launch templates
- Deployment options:
  - CloudFormation (simplified reference to quickstart)
  - Manual deployment (detailed step-by-step instructions)

### 5. Configuration Reference
- Directory structure and file placement
- File descriptions with purpose and format:
  - `config.json` (with inline examples of common configurations)
  - `partitions.json` (with inline examples showing key patterns)
  - Python scripts and their functions
- Cron setup and maintenance tasks

### 6. Usage Guide
- Basic commands for managing the cluster
- Testing functionality and validation steps
- Example workflows for common tasks
- Monitoring and management

### 7. Advanced Configuration
- Multiple partitions strategies
- Spot vs On-demand configuration options
- Custom node configurations for specialized workloads
- Real-world configuration examples for common scenarios

### 8. Troubleshooting
- Common issues and their solutions
- Logging and debugging information
- Where to look when things go wrong
- Community support resources

## Implementation Benefits

This restructured documentation will:

1. Create a clear learning path for new users
2. Separate conceptual information from technical details
3. Place examples alongside relevant configuration instructions
4. Organize information by user tasks rather than files
5. Highlight critical prerequisites early
6. Distinguish between quick start, main usage path, and advanced options

The reorganized README will better serve both new users (with the quickstart and conceptual information) and experienced users (with the reference sections and advanced configurations).
